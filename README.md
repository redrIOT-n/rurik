<name> is a terminal based text editor. I started this project to improve my knowledge on C programming and ncurses library. im trying to build every 
component of the text editor on my own.

User interface of the <name> is designed using ncurses and cdk libraries. 

<name> also consist of an embedded debugger, terminal and a file browser.

yet <name> does not fullfil all basics needs of a text editor. it is lack of copy and paste, auto completion and mant features. 

but im hoping to improve this text editor when i have time. all contributions are welcome.
